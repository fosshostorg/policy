Our team is entirely volunteers, who donate their labor.  We partner
with other organizations (our Sponsors and Partners) who provide us
with servers, rack-space, bandwidth, etc.  We use these resources to
create/provide/distribute services to our tenants (the projects we
host), with access to infrastructural technology services, for example
virtual private servers (VPS) and consoles of these.  We don't provide
remuneration/compensation to our Sponsors/Partners nor to our team,

<li>You can in otherwise influence our communications (if any) about our relationship if/when we partner together.</li>
<li>We can stop doing some or all of what we are doing for you at almost any time for almost any reason at our option.</li>

<li>Most publications at our discretion is in terms of this reporting and other information we possess remains in confidence to the extent possible for us.</li>
<li>Abuse of any kind is not tolerated and will usually cause some or all information related and kept within our other systems to become more vital.</li>
<li>We strongly prefer FOSS software and will not consider hosting other types of development or otherwise than development under a FOSS license.</li>
<li>We may, at our option, elect to use non-FOSS software but we will never incorporate it into our network or expect other than our own staff to use it.</li>
<li>Our staff give up some rights when then volunteer for us, such as to represent our directors in conducting the business of our organization &amp; mission.</li>

<p>
The PROCEDURES following define our customary and typical operating procedures, or help to further define those procedures we wish to put into place.
</p>

<p>
Each provides or may eventually replace the complete work within the specific and narrow scope set forth, and thus may to some specific extent and within an increasingly better (in terms of more concretely and more specifically and technically expressed) and more narrow means and purpose, contribute to our means by which we govern our organization or help to influence or direct our activities.  Each is presently, or as we intend it to be, describing a gradually more specific and technical process in terms of sequence of steps, their meaning and consequence to our activities, their reliance publicly or to or without or community, and as toward eventually, as fully and completely as we may find necessary, to document always our intentional means including our regular operating activities and procedures.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, the ITEMS below describe delegations of and not conference of authorities, creating a concept of "effective authority".  This enables volunteers to function with the full authority given they are operating within the specific bounds of our procedures.  By enabling those within our organization to act on and for our behalf, volunteers seek to grant each other and themselves a limited set of the wide latitude of authorities granted to our per our articles and policies as above, and in exchange they agree to the same limitations and conditions in the form of the exceptions set forth here above and below. No part of this document, including any ITEM below nor inclusion by reference of some or any other items or references be as limiting the responsibilities of Fosshost, nor any director with respect to our articles or else such policy as may be written above nor first or above in the below considering that version last accepted by all directors of record.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: In fact, the Fosshost board might be considered as the four individuals in terms of those who secure the liability shield under which we operate, however it is the mutual desire of all of the directors that we have and do operate for all intents and purposes such that Fosshost CTO Nate Sales can and does act as a fifth manager and director within our organization, including fully participating as per only his own inclination and availability to act, and continue to act as an equal member of our body, being the Fosshost board.  Generally, and absent any request he may have or in the future make, we  do afford him any rights and privileges otherwise due a member of our board.  Finally, our effective leader is Thomas Markee, our CEO and Founder.  All of the directors are confident in Thomas' leadership and pleased to support his direction for our future and the future of the FOSS movement.  These articles/procedures/policies are intended to delegate but do not in any way limit or otherwise undertake to change specifically or generally his authority over the Fosshost project, organization, nor any related assets or information as we may possess or control.

Where as some diligence may be requisite in following these procedures and making the records called for therein; however, (and notwithstanding our own training, certification, documentation, and related materials including our policies and procedures), our volunteers may have little or no specific expertise or training or otherwise certification even as may regard some or all of their specific and routine duties or other work for Fosshost.

In most routine circumstances, the operations director (or delegate) will review and summarily schedule and approve changes, logging such actions for the secretary to report to the board.  For some case where it may be necessary, we also provide for a an hierarchical decision making structure.  This generally serves to give our Chief Executive Officer or other directors the ability to intercept and redirect contentious decisions, and bring them before our board for consideration.  Absent contention, or specific intervention from our CEO, it places most complicated decision making authority with our Chief Technology Officer.   It also provides that the director will usually have specific criteria (stated in other procedures) for when rejecting/declining to schedule a given change.

We intend to document or otherwise describe nearly all of our internal procedures, while some details may be redacted and/or stored in more private repositories, we try to provide clear parameters around what we cannot publish, and to publish as much detail would be prudent and courteous and not more.

The items in this section describe tasks which are generally administrative but may include or reference other (e.g. more technical or more general) procedures elsewhere described in more detail.  Additionally, some details such as specific system names, symbolic links, keys, or other identifiers other than the names of people may be removed, replaced with placeholders, obscured, or otherwise concealed in those versions of our policies and procedures such as we make available publicly or otherwise than for our own (otherwise unrestrained) internal and necessary use.
