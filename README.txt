1 Information Security Disclosure: Risk, Control, and Measurement Documentation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  We use this documentation set, considering them as intents ("outward
  commitments") coupled with on-going empirical measurements of the
  practical effects of our project.

  To do this requires carefully gathering and maintaining verifiable and
  accessible versions of certain information, for example sometimes
  detailed or "verbatim" records (e.g. notes, recordings, etc.) of our
  internal or other communications and routine (or unusual) work.

  Just as with the work underlying maintenance for any complex
  inter-networked tool-set (FOSS or otherwise), these "requests" (and
  any such similarly intended requirements) can feel cumbersome.  They
  often seem to come when (and particularly frustrate us just as) we are
  reaching particularly interesting times, from an SDLC perspective.

  Moreover, they increase our overall risk potential in case of serious
  incident involving loss or theft of information not classified by
  Fosshost as appropriate for some actual dissemination.

  To mitigate potential harm in case of such incident we have
  established certain guidelines:

  ‣ We do not store information we don't need or expect to need.

  ‣ We prioritize and normalize removing information we do not need as
    part of daily operation.

  ‣ Where possible for confidential information (or otherwise where
    necessary) we mask data.

  ‣ We undertake to publicly disclose the general types of information
    we are regularly storing.

  However:

  ‣ We collect and retain certain information as a part of our everyday
    operation.

  ‣ We are generally free to measure and use this information as needed.

  ‣ Rules within our Our Policies must help us classify and safeguard
    information.

  ‣ Risks and Controls allow us to measure the actual safety of
    information in our charge.

  ‣ The information kept for measurement purposes can expose us to
    additional risk.

  ‣ We (generally) identify risks and select and measure controls at our
    digression.

    Meaning more specifically that:

    At our sole and absolute digression (except and always per/according
    to due process of law and the will of our regulators, community,
    volunteers, etc.), we may (and sometimes must if, for example,
    according to Our Policies, etc.) identify/measure certain risks and
    controls.

    At times, these such measurements may influence and/or include (or
    be accompanied by, e.g. link) outcomes, which we may document such
    as to include and/or reference the names (etc.) of our tenants or
    volunteers, for example and especially our directors and officers,
    etc.) and other sensitive or potentially sensitive information, and
    to incorporate some or all of the this/these into the extracts we
    create of/from/respecting Our Policies.

    As with any information we possess, should we become aware via use
    of this information of misconduct, for example violations of our
    terms of service, et. al. (for example, including violations of any
    volunteering or sponsorship agreements, of Our Policies by someone
    who has accepted and affirmed them, etc. our articles, etc.), then
    we may (and in some cases must) act on such information.
