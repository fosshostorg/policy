Thanks for your reply; this message confirms we've received your response

We're continuing to provision infrastructural goodness and will respond using this new (project-specific) ticket with detailed information as your new hosting platform(s) come online.

If you are comfortable, what information about typical workloads/processing patterns/job schedules as you may be able to share could be greatly helpful toward minimizing (or perhaps in some cases, avoiding) interruptions of service.

You can also reply to this new ticket with any questions.

If we have significant updates (or when we close the "master ticket") you might receive one or two more replies in the original thread.

In all events, we'll reply to this thread soonest to share (where possible, to coordinate) timing and other detail of your transition(s).

Warm regards,
Team Fosshost
